    <h5>Q.1) What are the current Force Levels of the Indian Navy? What are the ongoing projects? What steps are being undertaken by the Indian Navy to augment its strength?</h5>
  </div>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>
      The Indian Navy’s present force level comprises about 150 ships and submarines. The Indian Navy’s perspective-planning in terms of ‘force-levels’ is now driven by a conceptual shift from ‘numbers’ of platforms - that is, from the old ‘bean-counting’ philosophy—to one that concentrates upon ‘capabilities’. In terms of force accretions in the immediate future, we are acquiring ships in accordance with the Navy’s current Maritime Capability Perspective Plan.

    <h5>Q.3) After 26/11, what steps have been taken to strengthen the intelligence system and surveillance?</h5>
  </div>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>
      Consequent to the unfortunate events of 26/11, the coastal security has been reviewed at appropriate levels and the Cabinet Committee on Security in their meeting held in Feb 09 has approved certain proposals. The Indian Navy has been designated as the authority responsible for overall maritime security, which includes coastal security and offshore security. The Indian Navy, in this regard, will be assisted by Coast Guard, State Marine Police and other Central and State agencies for the coastal defence of the nation. The other initiatives to strengthen the coastal security are as follows:-
i) Setting up of Joint Operation Centres (JOCs) at Mumbai, Visakhapatnam, Kochi and Port Blair under the charge of the existing Naval C-in-Cs. In case of Port Blair, the JOC is under the charge of CINCAN. The JOCs are jointly manned and operated by the Navy and Coast Guard with inputs from diverse agencies such as Navy, Coast Guard and other Central and State Government agencies dealing with maritime aspects.

(ii) Formation of the Sagar Prahari Bal of the Navy comprising 80 Fast Interceptor Craft and 1000 personnel.

(iii) Regular conduct of Coastal Security exercises in all States in conjunction with the Coast Guard, State and Central Government agencies.
(iv) Enhancement of surface and air surveillance by Indian Navy and Coast Guard ships and aircraft along the coast and in all offshore development areas

(v) Conduct of awareness drives by the Navy and the Coast Guard to sensitize the fishing and coastal community and coastal/port authorities on issues related to security against threats from the sea.

(vi) Setting Up of Coastal Radar Chain and Coastal AIS chain in a time bound manner.

    <h5>Q.6) How do you grade Indian Navy today in terms of Operational preparedness?</h5>
  </div>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>
      The Indian Navy is fully prepared to safeguard the maritime interests of the nation. The country's maritime interests encompass maintenance of the territorial integrity of India against seaward challenges and threats as well as protection of our maritime trade and the merchantmen that embody it. Our coastline today faces significant security challenges from malevolent 'non-state', as well as 'state-sponsored' elements. To safeguard the maritime interests of the nation, the Navy performs four types of roles viz. military, diplomatic, constabulary and benign. For these roles, we have adequate capability and we are also continuously evolving to meet the new challenges posed by non-state actors and the modern day pirates.
